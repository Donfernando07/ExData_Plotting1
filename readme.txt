These plotting scripts each produce the corresponding png plots (i.e. plot1.R corresponds to plot1.png etc...)
The scripts already assume that you have unzipped the Electric Power Consumption dataset. 
Before running the script, please set the R working directory to wherever the file that contains the household_power_consumption.txt
